# Design Patterns: Not Just for Architects  
Level: Introductory 

Design patterns are not just for architects. In fact, you already use Design Patterns but probably don't know it. Observer, Facade, Iterator, Proxy - these are all patterns that allow us to better communicate our ideas with other developers. And once we understand the patterns, we can use solutions that people way smarter than us have already implemented. In this session, we'll take a look at several Gang of Four patterns that we regularly use without realizing it. Don't know who the Gang of Four is? Join us to find out.  

You will learn:

* What design patterns are  
* How you are already using design patterns (even if you don't realize it)  
* How intentional use of patterns can lead to better software

## Project Layout  

Each pattern has its own folder/project of the same name.  

* Observer/Observer.csproj  
* Iterator/Iterator.csproj  
* Facade/Facade.csproj  
* ChainOfResponsibility/ChainOfResponsibility.csproj  
* Proxy/Proxy.csproj  

In addition, there are 2 supporting projects:  

* People.Service/People.Service.csproj  
The service used by the "Proxy" sample.  
* Shared/Shared.csproj  
Shared elements like the "Person" object and sample data.  

## Running the Projects  
Each project can be started by setting the startup project from Visual Studio 2022 or by using "dotnet run" on the command line for the project.  

In order for the "Proxy" sample to work, the "People.Service" service must be started. To start the service, navigate to the "Person.Service" folder from the command line and type "dotnet run".

Ex:
```
C:\learning-design-patterns\People.Service> dotnet run
```  

The service endpoint can be found at [http://localhost:9874/people](http://localhost:9874/people)
